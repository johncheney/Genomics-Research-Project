Pipeline assembly and transcriptome analysis to prepare for (BGMP at UofO)


Goal of this repository are two-fold:

1. Run a pipeline for genome assembly from raw reads (from SRA) through annotation and genome statistics, then write a summary. 

2. Do a basic transcriptome analysis with SRA reads for an organism with a template genome, then repeat denovo.

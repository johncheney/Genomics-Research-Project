# Pipeline for genome assembly from raw SRA reads, annotation and genome statistics. 


# Step 1
# Obtain raw SRA reads 
#https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sradownload/

ÔºÉPrefetch 


# Step 2
# Inital quality testing with fastqc / multiqc 
# How many reads are available? Do they represent the genome? Are there adapters Present? 

# Step 3 
# Trim adapters/ filter data etc with Trimmomatic? BBtool? 
#Erroneous seqs and adapters are removed before assembly


# Step 4 
# Sequence Assembly
# Reads assembled into contigs

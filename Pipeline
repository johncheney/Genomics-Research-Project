# Pipeline for genome assembly from raw SRA reads, annotation and genome statistics. 


# Step 1
# Obtain raw SRA reads 
#https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sradownload/

#prefetch - downloads runs in compressed SRA format 
#fasterq-dump changes compressed SRA format to fasta


# Step 2
# Inital quality testing with fastqc / multiqc 
# How many reads are available? Do they represent the genome? Are there adapters Present? 
#https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html <- to download fastqc software 


# Step 3 
# Trim adapters/ filter data etc with Trimmomatic? BBduk? 
#Erroneous seqs and adapters are removed before assembly

# Step 4 
# Sequence Assembly (SPAdes)
# Reads assembled into contigs
